# Purpose / Motivation

Group project made for Artificial Intelligence course.

# General Info

Hand gesture recognition project using own implementation of convolutional neural network in python.  

Application needs photos of different hand gestures divided into classes.  
Photos are preprocessed in such a way that they meet expectations (e.g. size) of learning procedure.  

# Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV
  - hand photos processing
- NumPy
  - matrix operations in Convolutional Neural Network

# Future Works

- Usage of CUDA 

# Status

Realization of the project has ended as the project was submitted in the course
